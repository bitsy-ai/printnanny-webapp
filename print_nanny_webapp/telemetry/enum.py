# Python enum-based types required a custom Metaclass to support multi-inheritance
# Instead, I've just duplicated event types where inheritance is needed

# Example:
# TelemetryEventTypes is the Union of [OctoprintPluginEventTypes, OctoprintEventTypes, PrintJobEventTypes] etc
# but TelemetryEventTypes cannot be defined as inheriting from multiple enums with members defined
#
# I think the best long-term approach is to use Protobuf as the source of truth for schemas
# The data pipelines already use gRPC for inter-proc comms and django-db-model would make it easy to reference protobufs in Django model definitions
# django-db-model makes it easy to
