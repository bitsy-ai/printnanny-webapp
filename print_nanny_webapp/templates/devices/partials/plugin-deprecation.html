      <p>Print Nanny OS will replace the "OctoPrint Nanny" plugin in 2022 and beyond.</p>
      <p>Thank you for trying out the OctoPrint Plugin! ðŸ’œ Your feedback helped me <strong>radically improve</strong> Print Nanny's video quality and <strong>radically simplify</strong> installation.
      </p>
      
      <p>To meet this high bar, I created a <strong>full operating system</strong> pre-installed with computer vision tools, MQTT, and real-time video stream stack (and of course OctoPrint) 
      </p>

      <p>Don't worry! <strong>Print Nanny is still fully compatible with OctoPrint's control system</strong>, for example pausing/resuming a job.
